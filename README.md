# flightaware-debianstretch
A series of scripts to build dump1090 and flightaware, install and start in debian stretch command line

I've written this to help people with little experience set up a flightaware system under a command line version of Debian. 

If I've done it rught then all you need to do is run the following commands from a completely fresh installation of Debian stretch on the command line.

apt-get install git
git clone https://github.com/DnH2016/flightaware_debianstretch
cd flightawaware_debianstretch
./flightaware.sh

You can paste into putty using shift+insert

Then claim your receiver at flightaware on the following link.
